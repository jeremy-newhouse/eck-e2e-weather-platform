## Overview

All project documentation lives under `docs/` in the project root. Feature
documentation uses a flat layout — all deliverables at the same level inside
each feature directory. This keeps paths simple and consistent across the
lifecycle chain (`spec → design → develop → validate → deploy`).

## Project Documents (`docs/project/`)

High-level documents that define what is being built and why. Created by
`/start-project` and updated throughout the project lifecycle.

| Document          | Purpose                                              | Created By         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `VISION.md`       | Project vision, problem space, target users, roadmap | `/start-project`   |
| `BRD.md`          | Business requirements and success metrics            | `/design-document` |
| `PRD.md`          | Product requirements, user stories, personas         | `/design-document` |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | System architecture, components, infrastructure      | `/design-arch`     |
| `TECH-STACK.md`   | Technology decisions and decision log                | `/start-project`   |
| `BACKLOG.md`      | Feature backlog with priorities and sizing           | `/start-project`   |

---

## Feature Documents (`docs/features/{feature-slug}/`)

Each feature gets its own directory named with kebab-case (e.g., `user-auth`,
`payment-processing`). All deliverables live at the same level — no phase
subdirectories.

### Directory Naming

- Use **kebab-case** for feature directory names
- Derive from the feature name: `"User Authentication"` → `user-auth`
- No numeric prefixes on feature directories

### Feature Document Listing

```
docs/features/{feature-slug}/
├── FRD.md                    # Scope definition (problem, goals, out-of-scope)
├── DISCOVERY.md              # Requirements discovery notes
├── RESEARCH.md               # Context, ecosystem, feasibility research
├── DESIGN.md                 # Architecture design, component diagrams
├── DESIGN-SPEC.md            # Technical specification (API, DB, sequences)
├── RISK.md                   # Risk assessment
├── QA-PLAN.md                # Quality assurance test plan
├── TASKS.md                  # Task breakdown with dependency ordering
├── DESIGN-REVIEW.md          # Design completeness and AC-ID addressability gate result
├── DEV-NOTES.md              # Implementation notes, decisions during coding
├── DEVELOP-REVIEW.md         # Task completion, test passing, code quality gate result
├── VALIDATION.md             # Test results, quality gate outcomes
├── VALIDATE-REVIEW.md        # Unified validation verdict gate result
├── RELEASE.md                # Release notes
├── DEPLOY-RECORD.md          # Deployment record (env, date, status)
└── DEPLOY-REVIEW.md          # Stop-point-aware deployment readiness gate result
```

| Deploy          | `/deploy-review`    | `DEPLOY-REVIEW.md`               |

## Architecture Decision Records (`docs/adrs/`)

One file per significant architectural decision.

| Convention    | Rule                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Filename      | `ADR-NNN-{short-title}.md` (e.g., `ADR-001-tech-stack.md`) |
| Numbering     | Zero-padded 3-digit, sequential                            |
| Created by    | `/design-adr`                                              |
| Status values | `draft`, `accepted`, `superseded`                          |

---

## Documentation Index (`docs/INDEX.md`)

The master table of contents for all project documentation. Initialized by
`/start-project` from the `INDEX.md.template`.

### Auto-Generated Sections

Skills update INDEX.md automatically using marker comments:

```markdown
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: feature-list-start -->

...feature entries...

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: feature-list-end -->

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: adr-list-start -->

...ADR entries...

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: adr-list-end -->

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: deploy-list-start -->

...deployment records...

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED: deploy-list-end -->
```

Do not edit content between markers — it will be overwritten by skills.

## FRD.md vs DESIGN.md

These two documents serve different purposes at different lifecycle phases:

| Document    | Phase  | Purpose                       | Contains                                                       |
| ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FRD.md`    | Spec   | **What** to build and **why** | Problem statement, goals, scope boundaries, out-of-scope       |
| `DESIGN.md` | Design | **How** to build it           | API contracts, DB schemas, sequence diagrams, technical detail |

`FRD.md` is input to the design phase. `DESIGN.md` is output from it.

---

## Document File Naming Rules

| Convention     | Rule                                                                                |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type prefix    | UPPERCASE (`SPEC-`, `PRD-`, `ADR-`, `DESIGN-`, `RESEARCH-`, `RISKS-`, `INTERVIEW-`) |
| Topic suffix   | Lowercase kebab-case (`SPEC-api-contracts.md`)                                      |
| Lifecycle docs | No topic suffix needed (`FRD.md`, `TASKS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`)       |
| QA results     | Lowercase descriptive (`accessibility.md`, `test-results.md`)                       |

---

## Document Frontmatter

All project documents use YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "{Document Title}"
date: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
status: "draft"
feature: "{feature-slug}"
author: "{Author}"
version: "0.7.0"
type: "{document-type}"
---
```

### Status Values

```
draft → accepted → superseded
```

A superseded document must link to its replacement.
