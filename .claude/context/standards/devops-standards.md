# Git Workflow Standard

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-04
**Status**: Active

## Recommended .gitignore for Standards Documentation

If you're version controlling your Standards separately or as part of your Obsidian vault, add these to your `.gitignore`:

```gitignore
# Obsidian
.obsidian/workspace*
.obsidian/hotkeys.json
.obsidian/core-plugins-migration.json

# System files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.bak
*~

# Keep the Standards folder tracked
!Standards/
!Standards/**/*.md
```

## Git Workflow for Standards

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Initialize git in your Obsidian vault (if not already done)
cd /path/to/obsidian/vault
git init

# Add Standards to tracking
git add Standards/
git commit -m "feat: Add comprehensive standards documentation v1.0.0"

# Create a tag for the initial version
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial standards release"
```

### Making Changes to Standards

```bash
# 1. Create a feature branch
git checkout -b update/standard-name

# 2. Make your changes
# Edit the relevant .md files

# 3. Update CHANGELOG.md with your changes

# 4. Commit with conventional commit message
git add Standards/
git commit -m "docs(standards): Update [specific standard] for [reason]"

# 5. Push and create PR
git push origin update/standard-name
```

### Conventional Commit Types for Standards

- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `feat:` New standard or major addition
- `fix:` Correction to existing standard
- `refactor:` Reorganization without changing meaning
- `breaking:` Breaking change to standards

### Version Tagging Strategy

```bash
# For patch releases (clarifications, typos)
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Patch: Clarify server action requirements"

# for minor releases (new standards added)
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Minor: Add GraphQL standards"

# For major releases (breaking changes)
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Major: Restructure backend architecture"
```

## Integration with CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
# .github/workflows/standards-check.yml
name: Standards Documentation Check

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "Standards/**"

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Check CHANGELOG updated
        run: |
          if ! git diff HEAD^ HEAD --name-only | grep -q "Standards/CHANGELOG.md"; then
            echo "ERROR: CHANGELOG.md must be updated when changing standards"
            exit 1
          fi

      - name: Validate Markdown
        uses: DavidAnson/markdownlint-cli2-action@v11
        with:
          globs: "Standards/**/*.md"
```

## Syncing Standards Across Projects

### As a Git Submodule

```bash
# In your project repository
git submodule add https://github.com/yourorg/standards.git standards
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### As an NPM Package (for Frontend)

```json
// package.json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@yourorg/standards": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### As a Python Package (for Backend)

```toml
# pyproject.toml with uv
[tool.uv]
dev-dependencies = [
    "your-standards @ git+https://github.com/yourorg/standards.git@v1.0.0",
]
```

---

_This configuration ensures your standards are properly versioned and can be consistently applied across all projects._

# Quality Gates Standard

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-03
**Status**: Active

---

## Purpose

This standard defines quality gates, Definition of Ready (DoR), Definition of Done (DoD), and operational traceability requirements for development workflows.

---

## Quality Gates

### Gate 1: Local Development

Before creating a PR:

- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Linting passes with no warnings
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests added for new code
- [ ] Coverage meets minimum threshold (80%)

### Gate 2: Pull Request Creation

PR must include:

- [ ] Descriptive title with ID: `[FEAT-XXX] Description`
- [ ] Completed PR template
- [ ] Commits follow conventional format
- [ ] Branch up to date with develop
- [ ] No merge conflicts

### Gate 3: CI Pipeline (Automated)

| Check             | Tool         | Requirement         |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Frontend Lint     | ESLint       | 0 errors            |
| Frontend Types    | TypeScript   | 0 errors            |
| Frontend Tests    | Vitest       | 80%+ coverage       |
| Frontend Build    | Next.js      | Successful          |
| Backend Lint      | Ruff         | 0 errors            |
| Backend Types     | mypy         | 0 errors            |
| Backend Tests     | pytest       | 80%+ coverage       |
| Integration Tests | pytest       | All passing         |
| E2E Tests         | Playwright   | Critical paths pass |
| Security Scan     | CodeQL/Trivy | No high/critical    |

### Gate 4: Code Review

- [ ] At least 1 approval
- [ ] All comments addressed
- [ ] No unresolved threads
- [ ] Architecture patterns followed

        """FR-001: User can log in"""
```

**TypeScript:**

```typescript
describe("UserAuth [FEAT-001]", () => {
  it("[FR-001] logs in with valid credentials", () => {});
});
```

## Environment Promotion

### Environment Flow

```
Local Development
    ↓ (PR merged to develop)
Development/Integration
    ↓ (nightly or on-demand)
Staging
    ↓ (manual approval + release)
Production
```

### Environment Purposes

| Environment | Purpose                   | Deployment      | Data            |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Local       | Individual development    | Manual          | Seed/mock data  |
| Development | Integration testing       | Auto on merge   | Synthetic data  |
| Staging     | Pre-production validation | Manual trigger  | Production-like |
| Production  | Live users                | Manual approval | Real data       |

### Deployment Checklist

**Staging:**

- [ ] All CI checks pass on develop
- [ ] E2E tests pass
- [ ] Database migrations reviewed
- [ ] Environment variables updated
- [ ] Feature flags configured

**Production:**

- [ ] Staging sign-off received
- [ ] Release branch created
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Team notified
- [ ] Monitoring active

### Rollback Procedure

```bash
# 1. Identify the issue (check logs, metrics, error rates)

# 2. Decide to rollback (if critical issue affecting users)

# 3. Execute rollback
git revert <commit-hash>
# OR redeploy previous version tag

# 4. Database rollback (if needed - test first!)
uv run alembic downgrade -1

# 5. Verify (health endpoints, error rates)

# 6. Post-mortem (document and prevent recurrence)
```

## Best Practices

### Workflow Optimization

```yaml
# Use caching effectively
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: |
      ~/.npm
      node_modules
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-

# Run jobs in parallel when possible
jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  build:
    needs: [lint, test]  # Only after lint and test pass
```

### Secrets Management

```yaml
# Use GitHub environments for different stages
environment:
  name: production
  url: https://example.com

# Reference secrets securely
env:
  DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
```

### Matrix Builds

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    node: [20, 22]
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
  fail-fast: false
```

# Monitoring and Alerting Standards

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-03
**Status**: Active

## Overview

This document covers metrics collection, alerting, dashboards, and incident response.

For structured logging and tracing, see [Observability](../architecture/observability.md).

## Quick Reference

| Component     | Tool                   | Purpose                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Metrics       | Prometheus             | Time-series metrics collection     |
| Visualization | Grafana                | Dashboards and visualization       |
| Alerting      | Alertmanager           | Alert routing and notification     |
| Uptime        | Uptime Robot / Pingdom | External availability monitoring   |
| APM           | Sentry / Datadog       | Application performance monitoring |

## Metrics Collection

### Golden Signals

Monitor these four key metrics for every service:

| Signal     | Description               | Example Metric                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Latency    | Time to service a request | `http_request_duration_seconds`      |
| Traffic    | Request rate              | `http_requests_total`                |
| Errors     | Rate of failed requests   | `http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}` |
| Saturation | Resource utilization      | `container_memory_usage_bytes`       |

### FastAPI Metrics

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, generate_latest
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response
from starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware
import time

app = FastAPI()

# Define metrics
REQUEST_COUNT = Counter(
    "http_requests_total",
    "Total HTTP requests",
    ["method", "endpoint", "status"]
)

REQUEST_LATENCY = Histogram(
    "http_request_duration_seconds",
    "HTTP request latency in seconds",
    ["method", "endpoint"],
    buckets=[0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0]
)

REQUESTS_IN_PROGRESS = Gauge(
    "http_requests_in_progress",
    "Number of HTTP requests in progress",
    ["method", "endpoint"]
)


class MetricsMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    """Middleware to collect HTTP metrics."""

    async def dispatch(self, request: Request, call_next) -> Response:
        method = request.method
        endpoint = request.url.path

        # Track in-progress requests
        REQUESTS_IN_PROGRESS.labels(method=method, endpoint=endpoint).inc()

        start_time = time.perf_counter()
        try:
            response = await call_next(request)
            status = response.status_code
        except Exception:
            status = 500
            raise
        finally:
            duration = time.perf_counter() - start_time

            # Record metrics
            REQUEST_COUNT.labels(
                method=method,
                endpoint=endpoint,
                status=status
            ).inc()

            REQUEST_LATENCY.labels(
                method=method,
                endpoint=endpoint
            ).observe(duration)

            REQUESTS_IN_PROGRESS.labels(method=method, endpoint=endpoint).dec()

        return response


app.add_middleware(MetricsMiddleware)


@app.get("/metrics")
async def metrics() -> Response:
    """Prometheus metrics endpoint."""
    return Response(
        content=generate_latest(),
        media_type="text/plain"
    )
```

### Next.js Metrics

```typescript
// lib/metrics.ts
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";

interface RequestMetric {
  method: string;
  path: string;
  status: number;
  duration: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

class MetricsCollector {
  private metrics: RequestMetric[] = [];
  private maxSize = 10000;

  record(metric: RequestMetric): void {
    this.metrics.push(metric);
    if (this.metrics.length > this.maxSize) {
      this.metrics = this.metrics.slice(-this.maxSize);
    }
  }

  getMetrics(): RequestMetric[] {
    return [...this.metrics];
  }

  // Calculate percentiles
  getLatencyPercentile(percentile: number): number {
    const sorted = this.metrics.map((m) => m.duration).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const index = Math.ceil((percentile / 100) * sorted.length) - 1;
    return sorted[index] || 0;
  }
}

export const metricsCollector = new MetricsCollector();

// middleware.ts
export function middleware(request: NextRequest): NextResponse {
  const start = Date.now();
  const response = NextResponse.next();

  // Record metric after response
  const duration = Date.now() - start;
  metricsCollector.record({
    method: request.method,
    path: request.nextUrl.pathname,
    status: response.status,
    duration,
    timestamp: new Date(),
  });

  return response;
}
```

### Custom Business Metrics

```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Gauge

# Business metrics
ORDERS_CREATED = Counter(
    "orders_created_total",
    "Total orders created",
    ["payment_method", "region"]
)

ACTIVE_USERS = Gauge(
    "active_users",
    "Number of active users in the last 5 minutes"
)

CART_VALUE = Histogram(
    "cart_value_dollars",
    "Shopping cart value in dollars",
    buckets=[10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000]
)


async def create_order(order: OrderCreate) -> Order:
    """Create a new order with metrics."""
    result = await order_service.create(order)

    # Record business metric
    ORDERS_CREATED.labels(
        payment_method=order.payment_method,
        region=order.region
    ).inc()

    return result
```

## Alert Configuration

### Alert Severity Levels

| Severity | Response Time     | Examples                                 |
| -------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Critical | < 5 minutes       | Service down, data loss risk             |
| High     | < 30 minutes      | High error rate, degraded performance    |
| Medium   | < 4 hours         | Elevated latency, capacity warning       |
| Low      | Next business day | Minor issues, optimization opportunities |

### Alertmanager Configuration

## Uptime Monitoring

### External Health Checks

```python
# app/api/health.py

```

### Synthetic Monitoring

```typescript
// scripts/synthetic-monitor.ts
interface HealthCheckResult {
  endpoint: string;
  status: "pass" | "fail";
  latencyMs: number;
  statusCode?: number;
  error?: string;
}

      method: "GET",
      headers: { "User-Agent": "SyntheticMonitor/1.0" },
      signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10000),
    });

    return {
      endpoint,
      status: response.ok ? "pass" : "fail",
      latencyMs: Date.now() - start,
      statusCode: response.status,
    };
  } catch (error) {

  // Report to monitoring system
  for (const result of results) {

## Incident Response

### Incident Severity Classification

| Severity | Impact            | Examples                    | Response             |
| -------- | ----------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| SEV1     | Complete outage   | Site down, data loss        | All hands, war room  |
| SEV2     | Major degradation | Core feature broken         | On-call + backup     |
| SEV3     | Partial impact    | Non-critical feature down   | On-call investigates |
| SEV4     | Minor issue       | Cosmetic bugs, slow queries | Normal workflow      |

### Runbook Template

````markdown
# Runbook: High Error Rate Alert

## Alert Details

- **Alert Name**: HighErrorRate
- **Severity**: High
- **Escalation**: Page on-call if not resolved in 15 minutes

## Symptoms

- Error rate > 5% for 5+ minutes
- Users may see 500 errors

## Investigation Steps

1. **Check recent deployments**
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout history deployment/api
   ```
````

2. **View error logs**

   ```bash
   kubectl logs -l app=api --tail=100 | grep ERROR
   ```

3. **Check database connectivity**

   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod -l app=api -o name | head -1) -- \
     python -c "from app.db import get_db; print('DB OK')"
   ```

4. **Check external dependencies**
   - Stripe status: https://status.stripe.com
   - Clerk status: https://status.clerk.com

## Resolution Steps

### If recent deployment caused issue:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/api
```

### If database connection issue:

1. Check connection pool
2. Restart affected pods
3. Check database health

### If external service issue:

1. Enable circuit breaker
2. Return cached/fallback data
3. Monitor external status

## Post-Incident

- [ ] Document timeline
- [ ] Identify root cause
- [ ] Create follow-up tickets
- [ ] Update runbook if needed

## Cost Monitoring

### Cloud Cost Alerts

```python
# Example: AWS cost monitoring
import boto3
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def check_costs():
    """Check daily AWS costs and alert if anomalous."""
    ce = boto3.client('ce')

    # Get costs for last 7 days
    response = ce.get_cost_and_usage(
        TimePeriod={
            'Start': (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
            'End': datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
        },
        Granularity='DAILY',
        Metrics=['BlendedCost']
    )

    costs = [
        float(day['Total']['BlendedCost']['Amount'])
        for day in response['ResultsByTime']
    ]

    avg_cost = sum(costs[:-1]) / len(costs[:-1])
    today_cost = costs[-1]

    # Alert if today is 50% higher than average
    if today_cost > avg_cost * 1.5:
        send_alert(
            title="Unusual AWS Spending",
            message=f"Today's cost ${today_cost:.2f} is {((today_cost/avg_cost)-1)*100:.0f}% higher than 7-day average ${avg_cost:.2f}"
        )
```

## Best Practices

### Alert Hygiene

1. **Actionable alerts only** - Every alert should have a clear response action
2. **Avoid alert fatigue** - Tune thresholds to reduce noise
3. **Document runbooks** - Every alert should have a runbook
4. **Review regularly** - Audit alerts quarterly, remove unused ones
5. **Test alerts** - Periodically verify alerts fire correctly

### Dashboard Guidelines

1. **Purpose-driven** - Each dashboard serves a specific use case
2. **Consistent layout** - Use standard panel arrangements
3. **Time ranges** - Default to last 1 hour, allow customization
4. **Drill-down** - Link to detailed views
5. **Documentation** - Include panel descriptions

### Metric Naming Conventions

```
# Format: <namespace>_<subsystem>_<name>_<unit>

# Good
http_requests_total
http_request_duration_seconds
database_connections_active
orders_created_total

# Bad
requests              # Too vague
httpRequestTime       # camelCase
db_conn               # Unclear abbreviation
```

## 3. Code Review Checklist

Reviewers must verify all items before approving:

### Functionality
- [ ] Code accomplishes the stated task requirements
- [ ] Edge cases are properly handled
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate and user-friendly
- [ ] No obvious bugs or logic errors
- [ ] Follows the SSR with Server Actions pattern

### Architecture
- [ ] Follows data flow: Client → Server Action → FastAPI → PostgreSQL
- [ ] No direct API calls from client components
- [ ] Server components used where possible
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns

### Code Quality
- [ ] Follows project coding standards (TypeScript/Python)
- [ ] No code duplication (DRY principle)
- [ ] Functions/methods are focused (Single Responsibility)
- [ ] Naming is clear, consistent, and descriptive
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use config/env vars)
- [ ] No debug code or console.log statements
- [ ] No `any` types in TypeScript

### Type Safety
- [ ] TypeScript: Explicit return types on functions
- [ ] TypeScript: Discriminated unions for state management
- [ ] Python: Type hints on all functions
- [ ] Pydantic models for API request/response
- [ ] Zod schemas for frontend validation

### Security
- [ ] No secrets or credentials in code
- [ ] Authentication checked in server actions
- [ ] Authorization verified before operations
- [ ] Input validation present (Zod/Pydantic)
- [ ] SQL injection prevented (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- [ ] XSS prevention in frontend
- [ ] CSRF protection for mutations
- [ ] Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests cover new functionality
- [ ] Tests are meaningful (not just for coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for API changes
- [ ] Component tests for UI changes
- [ ] Tests are deterministic (no flakiness)
- [ ] Edge cases have test coverage

### Performance
- [ ] No N+1 queries (use eager loading)
- [ ] Appropriate caching implemented
- [ ] Large lists paginated
- [ ] Images optimized (next/image)
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders

### Documentation
- [ ] Public functions have docstrings/JSDoc
- [ ] Complex logic has explanatory comments
- [ ] README updated if needed
- [ ] API documentation updated (OpenAPI)

## Health Check Endpoints

### Next.js Health Check

```typescript
// app/api/health/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({
    status: "healthy",
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  });
}
```

### FastAPI Health Check

```python
# app/api/routers/health.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from sqlalchemy import text

from app.api.deps import get_db
from app.core.cache import cache

router = APIRouter()


@router.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    """Basic health check."""
    return {"status": "healthy"}


@router.get("/health/ready")
async def readiness_check(db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)):
    """Readiness check with dependency verification."""
    checks = {
        "database": False,
        "redis": False,
    }

    # Check database
    try:
        await db.execute(text("SELECT 1"))
        checks["database"] = True
    except Exception:
        pass

    # Check Redis
    try:
        await cache.redis.ping()
        checks["redis"] = True
    except Exception:
        pass

    status = "healthy" if all(checks.values()) else "unhealthy"
    status_code = 200 if status == "healthy" else 503

    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=status_code,
        content={
            "status": status,
            "checks": checks,
        },
    )
```

## Security Best Practices

### Non-Root User

```dockerfile
# Always create and use non-root user
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 appgroup
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 appuser
USER appuser
```

### Read-Only Filesystem

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  backend:
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
    volumes:
      - type: tmpfs
        target: /app/tmp
```

### Security Scanning

```bash
# Scan image for vulnerabilities
docker scout cves myimage:latest

# Use Trivy
trivy image myimage:latest
```

### Secrets Management

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  backend:
    secrets:
      - db_password
      - api_key

secrets:
  db_password:
    file: ./secrets/db_password.txt
  api_key:
    external: true
```

## Frontend Environment Variables

### .env.example

```bash
# .env.example - Copy to .env.local and fill in values

# ======================
# PUBLIC VARIABLES
# These are exposed to the browser
# ======================

# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Authentication (Clerk)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx

# Feature Flags
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_ANALYTICS=false

# ======================
# SERVER-ONLY VARIABLES
# These are only available in server components/actions
# ======================

# Authentication
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx

# Internal API
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
INTERNAL_API_KEY=xxx

# ======================
# BUILD-TIME VARIABLES
# ======================
ANALYZE=false
```

### Environment Validation

```typescript
// lib/env.ts
import { z } from "zod";

const envSchema = z.object({
  // Public (available in browser)
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: z.string().url(),
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL: z.string().url(),
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: z.string().startsWith("pk_"),

  // Server-only
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY: z.string().startsWith("sk_"),
  BACKEND_URL: z.string().url(),

  // Optional
  SENTRY_DSN: z.string().url().optional(),
});

// Validate at build time
export const env = envSchema.parse({
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL,
  NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL,
  NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY:
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY,
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY,
  BACKEND_URL: process.env.BACKEND_URL,
  SENTRY_DSN: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
});

// Type-safe access
export type Env = z.infer<typeof envSchema>;
```

### Usage

```typescript
// In server components/actions
import { env } from "@/lib/env";

const response = await fetch(`${env.BACKEND_URL}/api/users`);

// In client components (only NEXT_PUBLIC_* available)
const apiUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
```

## Per-Environment Configuration

### Development

```bash
# .env (development)
ENVIRONMENT=development
DEBUG=true
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
RELOAD=true

DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/myapp_dev
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

CORS_ORIGINS=["http://localhost:3000"]

# Use test keys for external services
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
```

### Staging

```bash
# Environment variables (set in CI/CD or server)
ENVIRONMENT=staging
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
RELOAD=false

DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@staging-db:5432/myapp_staging
REDIS_URL=redis://staging-redis:6379/0

CORS_ORIGINS=["https://staging.example.com"]

# Use test keys but with staging config
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx@sentry.io/staging
```

### Production

```bash
# Environment variables (set via secrets manager)
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING
RELOAD=false

DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@prod-db:5432/myapp
REDIS_URL=redis://prod-redis:6379/0

CORS_ORIGINS=["https://example.com", "https://www.example.com"]

# Live keys
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx@sentry.io/production
```

---

## Secrets Management

### Local Development

```bash
# Use .env files (gitignored)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your local values
```

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

```yaml
# Use GitHub secrets and variables
env:
  DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
  CLERK_SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.CLERK_SECRET_KEY }}

# Use environments for different stages
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment: production
    steps:
      - name: Deploy
        env:
          DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.DATABASE_URL }}
```

### Production (Cloud Providers)

#### AWS Secrets Manager

```python
# app/core/secrets.py
import boto3
import json
from functools import lru_cache


@lru_cache
def get_secret(secret_name: str) -> dict:
    """Fetch secret from AWS Secrets Manager."""
    client = boto3.client("secretsmanager")
    response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId=secret_name)
    return json.loads(response["SecretString"])


# Usage in settings
if settings.ENVIRONMENT == "production":
    secrets = get_secret("myapp/production")
    DATABASE_URL = secrets["database_url"]
```

#### Docker Secrets

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  backend:
    secrets:
      - db_password
      - clerk_secret

secrets:
  db_password:
    file: ./secrets/db_password.txt
  clerk_secret:
    external: true
```

```python
# Read Docker secret
def read_secret(name: str) -> str:
    """Read Docker secret."""
    secret_path = f"/run/secrets/{name}"
    try:
        with open(secret_path) as f:
            return f.read().strip()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return None
```

---

## Feature Flags

### Configuration

```python
# app/core/features.py
from app.core.config import settings


class FeatureFlags:
    """Feature flag management."""

    @property
    def new_api(self) -> bool:
        return settings.FEATURE_NEW_API

    @property
    def beta_features(self) -> bool:
        # Only in non-production
        return not settings.is_production

    def is_enabled(self, flag: str) -> bool:
        """Check if a feature flag is enabled."""
        return getattr(self, flag, False)


features = FeatureFlags()
```

### Usage

```python
# In routes
@router.get("/new-endpoint")
async def new_endpoint():
    if not features.new_api:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404)
    return {"message": "New API"}


# In templates
if features.is_enabled("dark_mode"):
    # Enable dark mode
```

## Environment Checklist

### Development Setup

- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- [ ] Fill in local database credentials
- [ ] Set up local Redis instance
- [ ] Configure authentication test keys
- [ ] Set `DEBUG=true`

### Staging Deployment

- [ ] All secrets in CI/CD secrets store
- [ ] Test API keys configured
- [ ] Sentry DSN set
- [ ] CORS origins updated
- [ ] Health check endpoints working

### Production Deployment

- [ ] All secrets in secure secrets manager
- [ ] Production API keys configured
- [ ] `DEBUG=false`
- [ ] Appropriate log level
- [ ] CORS origins restricted
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Monitoring configured

---

## Security Best Practices

### Never Commit Secrets

```gitignore
# .gitignore
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local
*.pem
*.key
secrets/
```

### Rotate Secrets Regularly

```bash
# Create rotation schedule
# - API keys: Quarterly
# - Database passwords: Monthly
# - JWT secrets: Bi-annually
```

### Audit Secret Access

```python
# Log when secrets are accessed
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def get_secret(name: str) -> str:
    logger.info(f"Secret accessed: {name}")
    # ... fetch secret
```
