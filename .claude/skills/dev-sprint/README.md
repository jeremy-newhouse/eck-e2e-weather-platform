# Develop-Sprint Skill - Modular Structure

This skill executes a sprint's worth of tasks with dependency ordering, tracker state persistence, and sprint summary.

### prompts/developer.md

Developer dispatch template. Contains:

- Complete prompt template for dispatching developer agents
- Tracker constants
- Task details structure
- Success criteria format
- Agent selection guidance
- Specification references
- Sprint context
- Dependencies
- File hints
- Progress tracking via parent task comments (NOT subtasks)

### prompts/planner.md

Planning prompt template. Contains:

- Dependency analysis prompt
- Topological sort algorithm guidance
- Execution plan output template

## Benefits of Modular Structure

1. **Maintainability:** Each stage in its own file makes updates easier
2. **Readability:** Slim main file with clear references
3. **Reusability:** Prompt templates can be reused across skills
4. **Navigation:** Easy to jump to specific stage documentation
5. **Context Management:** Smaller files reduce token usage when reading specific phases
6. **Separation of Concerns:** Prerequisites, planning, execution, and closure are logically separated
