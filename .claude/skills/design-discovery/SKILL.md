## Usage

```
/design-discovery <feature-description>
```

Examples:

```
/design-discovery user notification preferences

```

**Output:** `docs/{feature}/DESIGN-DISCOVERY.md` containing architecture decisions, design constraints, and technical findings.

---

## Stage 1: Prepare

Research existing context and determine the technical domain set.

### Inputs

- `$ARGUMENTS` — feature description
- `.claude/project-constants.md` — project key, paths, tech stack, `3` (1-5)
- `docs/{feature}/FRD.md` — functional requirements and AC-IDs (if present)
- `docs/{feature}/DISCOVERY.md` — spec-phase discovery findings (if present)
- `docs/{feature}/RESEARCH.md` — research findings (if present)
- Development mode via `mode:read-dev-rigor` primitive
- Codebase structure via `codebase:explore` primitive

### Activities

1. Read project constants:

   ```bash
   cat "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/project-constants.md"
   ```

   If missing, STOP: "Run `/start-project` first to define project constants."

2. Resolve development mode using the `mode:read-dev-rigor` primitive.

3. Load prior artifacts:
   - FRD.md — acceptance criteria and open questions
   - DISCOVERY.md — spec-phase discovery findings (decisions, assumptions, requirements)
   - RESEARCH.md — research findings

4. Use the `codebase:explore` primitive to identify:
   - Existing architectural patterns relevant to the feature
   - Integration points and dependencies
   - Technical debt or constraints in affected areas

5. **MUST** determine the domain set based on `3`. Do NOT use a fixed domain set — always consult the gating table below:

   **Design Discovery Domains:**

   | #   | Domain                   | PoC (1-2)  | MVP (3)     | Prod (4-5) |
   | --- | ------------------------ | ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
   | 1   | Architecture Approach    | Required   | Required    | Required   |
   | 2   | Data Model & Storage     | Light-pass | Required    | Required   |
   | 3   | API & Integration Design | Skip       | Required    | Required   |
   | 4   | Security & Auth Design   | Skip       | Conditional | Required   |
   | 5   | Operations & Deployment  | Skip       | Light-pass  | Required   |
   | 6   | Risk & Tradeoffs         | Required   | Required    | Required   |

6. Apply mode calibration:
   - **Lite**: Required domains only. Propose defaults, accept single confirmations.
   - **Standard**: Required + Light-pass + Conditional (when triggered). Full Present-React-Confirm cycle.
   - **Strict**: All domains. Deep tradeoff surfacing, quantification.

7. **MUST** prepare the Opening Move (Context Briefing, Draft Understanding, Discovery Agenda). Do NOT skip the Opening Move or proceed directly to domain discovery.

### Outputs

- Technical context loaded from prior artifacts
- Domain set determined with gating applied
- Opening Move prepared

### Exit Criteria

- All available prior artifacts loaded
- Domain set determined based on project type and mode
- Opening Move prepared

---

## Stage 2: Discover

Conduct domain-by-domain collaborative technical discovery.

### Inputs

- Domain set and gating from Stage 1
- Prior artifact context (FRD.md, DISCOVERY.md, RESEARCH.md)
- `planning:question-patterns` primitive
- `planning:completeness-check` primitive

### Activities

> **Rule:** Do not proceed to Stage 3 until at least the Architecture Approach domain is complete. Never assume answers. No fixed round limit — continue until completeness check signals SUGGEST_WRAP or COMPLETE.

#### Opening Move

Present the three-part opening:

1. **Context Briefing** — what's known from spec-phase discovery and codebase analysis:

   ```
   From the spec discovery and codebase analysis:

   - Requirements: {summary of key requirements from DISCOVERY.md}
   - {N} decisions confirmed, {N} assumptions from spec phase
   - Existing architecture: {patterns found in codebase}
   - Tech stack: {current stack from project-constants}
   ```

2. **Draft Understanding** — strawman technical approach for reaction:

   ```
   Based on the requirements and existing codebase, here's a proposed
   technical approach:

     "{Feature} could be implemented as {approach} using {pattern},
      extending the existing {module}. The main technical challenge
      is {challenge}."

   Does this direction make sense? What would you change?
   ```

3. **Discovery Agenda** — proposed technical domains:

   ```
   Technical Discovery Agenda
   ------------------------------------------------------
     1  Architecture Approach    patterns and boundaries
     2  Data Model & Storage     schema and persistence
     3  Risk & Tradeoffs         technical risks
   ------------------------------------------------------
     {N} of 6 domains (adjusted for {project_type})

   Would you like to adjust this agenda?
   ```

#### Domain-by-Domain Discovery

For each domain in the gated set:

1. **Domain transition banner:**

   ```
   [x] Architecture Approach -- decisions made
   [>] Data Model & Storage -- starting
   ```

2. **Update statusline** with current domain:

   ```bash
   bash ~/.claude/evolv-coder-kit/update-stage.sh "Discover (2/4)"
   ```

3. **For Required domains** — use Present-React-Confirm:
   a. Research: Explore codebase for domain-specific context
   b. Propose: Present 2-3 options with tradeoffs, or a specific recommendation with rationale
   c. Ask: "Which approach fits? What constraints am I missing?"
   d. Incorporate: Update evolving technical decisions
   e. Confirm: "Here's what I've captured for {domain}. Accurate?"

4. **For Light-pass domains** — present inference:

   ```
   Based on the existing {pattern} and spec discovery findings,
   I'd assume {inference}. Correct, or should we discuss further?
   ```

5. **For Conditional domains** — check if feature touches auth, PII, or external data. If so, treat as Required. If not, skip silently.

6. **Active Listening** — surface technical implications:
   - "If we use {pattern}, that means {consequence} for {related area}"
   - "This connects to the {decision} from spec discovery"

7. **Tradeoff comparison tables** when presenting options:

   ```
   Options: Data Storage Approach
   ------------------------------------------------------
     A  Extend users table    simple    no migration  limited
     B  New preferences tbl   flexible  migration     queryable
     C  JSON column           flexible  no migration  no queries
   ------------------------------------------------------
     Recommendation: B (aligns with admin reporting requirement from D4)
   ```

8. **Domain summary checkpoint** after each domain:

   ```
   [x] Data Model & Storage -- 3 decisions, 0 assumptions

   Decisions
   ------------------------------------------------------
     D5  PostgreSQL dedicated table              confirmed
     D6  Foreign key to users, cascade delete    confirmed
     D7  Alembic migration, reversible           confirmed
   ------------------------------------------------------
   ```

9. **Display updated Discovery Map** after each domain transition.

#### Completeness Check

After each domain, evaluate using `planning:completeness-check`:

- CONTINUE: Critical technical gaps remain
- SUGGEST_WRAP: Good coverage for project type
- COMPLETE: Full technical coverage

### Outputs

- Technical decisions for each domain explored (D-prefixed, continuing from spec phase numbering)
- Technical assumptions (A-prefixed)
- Domain coverage status

### Exit Criteria

- All Required domains completed
- Light-pass domains confirmed or escalated
- Conditional domains checked and handled
- Completeness check signals SUGGEST_WRAP or COMPLETE

---

## Stage 3: Synthesize

Extract structured technical decisions from the discovery.

### Inputs

- Complete discovery transcript from Stage 2
- FRD.md acceptance criteria (for cross-referencing)

### Activities

1. Parse all responses and derive:

   **Architecture Decisions** — key technical choices (component boundaries, patterns, frameworks).

   **Design Constraints** — technical limitations (performance budgets, backward compatibility, platform constraints).

   **Integration Requirements** — external services, APIs, and data flows.

   **Open Technical Questions** — unresolved items requiring further investigation or PoC work.

   **AC-ID Mapping** — map technical decisions to FRD.md AC-IDs where applicable. Flag any AC-IDs that imply technical work not covered by the discovery.

2. **MUST** display synthesized findings to the user for confirmation via `AskUserQuestion`. Do NOT skip user confirmation or assume approval.

### Outputs

- Structured technical findings
- AC-ID cross-reference mapping
- User-confirmed synthesis

### Exit Criteria

- All discovery responses parsed and categorized
- Findings confirmed by user

---

## Stage 4: Document

Write the discovery output to `docs/{feature}/DESIGN-DISCOVERY.md`.
