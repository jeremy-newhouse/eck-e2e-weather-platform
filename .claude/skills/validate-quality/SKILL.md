# Validate Quality

Run quality gates for: $ARGUMENTS

## Visual Framework

Follow the visual framework defined in the `output:visual-framework` primitive.

## Task Registration

| Stage | Subject            | Active Form       | Statusline      |
| ----- | ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- |
| 1     | Stage 1: Calibrate | Calibrating gates | Calibrate (1/4) |
| 2     | Stage 2: Tests     | Running tests     | Tests (2/4)     |
| 3     | Stage 3: Lint      | Running linter    | Lint (3/4)      |
| 4     | Stage 4: Types     | Checking types    | Types (4/4)     |

### Statusline Stage Updates

At the **start** of each stage, update the statusline:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/evolv-coder-kit/update-stage.sh "{Statusline text from table}"
```

At **skill completion** (success or error), reset:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/evolv-coder-kit/update-stage.sh
```

## Usage

```
/validate-quality
/validate-quality --rigor lite
/validate-quality --rigor standard
/validate-quality --rigor strict
```

---

## Stage 1: Calibrate

### Inputs

- `$ARGUMENTS` — optional `--rigor` flag
- `mode:read-dev-rigor` primitive — resolves the current development mode
- Project config files: `jest.config.*`, `vitest.config.*`, `pytest.ini`, `.eslintrc*`, `pyproject.toml`, `tsconfig.json`, `mypy.ini`
- `.claude/project-constants.md` — `{TEST_COMMAND}`, `{LINT_COMMAND}`, `{TYPECHECK_COMMAND}`

### Activities

1. Resolve development mode using the `mode:read-dev-rigor` primitive.

2. Detect tooling from project config files:
   - Test runner: check for `jest`, `vitest`, `pytest`, `node --test`, or `{TEST_COMMAND}` in `project-constants.md`
   - Linter: check for `.eslintrc*`, `pyproject.toml` (ruff/flake8), or `{LINT_COMMAND}` in `project-constants.md`
   - Type checker: check for `tsconfig.json`, `mypy.ini`, or `{TYPECHECK_COMMAND}` in `project-constants.md`

3. Display mode banner:

   ```
   --- {Mode Name} Mode (Level {N}: {Label}) ---
   Gates: {tests only|tests+lint|tests+lint+types}
   Tip: Use --rigor lite|standard|strict to override
   ---------------------------------------------
   ```

4. Apply mode calibration to gate selection:
   - **Lite**: Run tests only (Phases 3 and 4 are skipped)
   - **Standard**: Run tests + lint (Stage 4 is skipped)
   - **Strict**: Run tests + lint + type checks

### Outputs

- Resolved development mode (lite / standard / strict)
- Detected tooling for each gate (test runner, linter, type checker)
- Gate selection plan (which phases will run vs skip)

### Exit Criteria

- Development mode resolved and banner displayed
- All available gate tools detected
- Gate selection plan determined based on mode

---

## Stage 2: Tests

### Inputs

- `{TEST_COMMAND}` from `.claude/project-constants.md` under "Quality Gate Configuration"
- `review:test` primitive

### Activities

1. Look up `{TEST_COMMAND}` from `.claude/project-constants.md` under "Quality Gate Configuration".
2. Run the `review:test` primitive using the resolved test command.
3. Report:
   - Pass/fail count per suite
   - Coverage percentage if the runner outputs it
   - Full error output for any failing tests

### Outputs

- Test results: pass/fail count per suite
- Coverage percentage (if available)
- Full error output for failing tests

### Exit Criteria

- Test command executed and results captured
- Pass/fail counts and any errors reported

---

## Stage 3: Lint

**Lite mode**: Skip this stage entirely.

### Inputs

- `{LINT_COMMAND}` from `.claude/project-constants.md` under "Quality Gate Configuration"
- `review:lint` primitive
- Gate selection plan from Stage 1 (determines whether this stage runs)

### Activities

1. Look up `{LINT_COMMAND}` from `.claude/project-constants.md` under "Quality Gate Configuration".
2. Run the `review:lint` primitive using the resolved lint command.
3. Report:
   - Error count and warning count
   - File paths and line numbers for each finding
   - Full lint output on failure

### Outputs

- Lint results: error count and warning count
- File paths and line numbers for each finding
- Full lint output (on failure)

### Exit Criteria

- Lint command executed and results captured (or stage skipped in lite mode)
- Error and warning counts reported

---

## Stage 4: Types

**Lite and Standard modes**: Skip this stage entirely.

### Inputs

- `{TYPECHECK_COMMAND}` from `.claude/project-constants.md` under "Quality Gate Configuration"
- `review:typecheck` primitive
- Gate selection plan from Stage 1 (determines whether this stage runs)

### Activities

1. Look up `{TYPECHECK_COMMAND}` from `.claude/project-constants.md` under "Quality Gate Configuration".
2. If `{TYPECHECK_COMMAND}` is `N/A`, skip and note that type checking is not configured for this project.
3. Run the `review:typecheck` primitive using the resolved type-check command.
4. Report:
   - Total type error count
   - File paths, line numbers, and error messages for each finding

### Outputs

- Type check results: total error count
- File paths, line numbers, and error messages for each finding

### Exit Criteria

- Type check command executed and results captured (or stage skipped in lite/standard mode)
- All type errors reported with file locations

---

## Final: Quality Gate Decision

**MUST** apply `validation:quality-gate` to determine the overall pass/fail verdict across all gates that ran. Do NOT skip the verdict computation.

- **MUST** report a summary table of each gate with PASS/FAIL status.
- If any gate fails, **MUST** list all failures before reporting the final verdict. Do NOT silently swallow failures.
- Each gate is independent — **MUST** report all results even if one fails earlier.

### Stage Exit Verification

Before reporting the final verdict, **MUST** verify:

- [ ] All scheduled gates have been executed (or explicitly skipped by mode)
- [ ] Results are captured for every executed gate

If any scheduled gate was not executed and not explicitly skipped: report as FAIL for that gate.

---

## Error Handling

- If a gate command is not found or exits with an unexpected error (not a test failure), report the error and continue to the next gate.
- Do not abort the skill on a single gate failure; complete all scheduled gates first.
- At completion (success or error), reset the statusline:
  ```bash
  bash ~/.claude/evolv-coder-kit/update-stage.sh
  ```
