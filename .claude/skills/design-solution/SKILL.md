## Stage 1: Context

### Inputs

- `project-constants.md` — tech stack variables and project type
- `docs/research/` — RESEARCH.md, interview notes, requirements documents
- `docs/design/` — existing architecture documentation

### Activities

Load all available prior planning artifacts before dispatching design agents:

1. Read project constants:
   ```bash
   cat "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/project-constants.md"
   ```
2. Load RESEARCH.md if present:
   ```bash
   ls "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/docs/research/" 2>/dev/null
   ```
3. Load interview notes / requirements document if present:
   ```bash
   ls "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/docs/research/" 2>/dev/null
   ```
4. Read existing architecture documentation:
   ```bash
   cat "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/docs/design/" 2>/dev/null || echo "No design directory"
   ```
5. Read tech stack from `project-constants.md`:
   - `{FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK}`, `{BACKEND_FRAMEWORK}`, `{DATABASE}`
   - `3` (determines design depth)
6. **MUST** produce a context summary confirming available inputs before proceeding. Do NOT dispatch agents without first confirming what artifacts are available.

### Outputs

- Context summary listing all discovered artifacts and tech stack values
- Determination of which specialist agents to dispatch in Stage 2

### Exit Criteria

- Project constants loaded and tech stack variables identified
- All available research and requirements artifacts catalogued
- Context summary produced and confirmed before agent dispatch

---

## Stage 2: Architect

### Inputs

- Context summary from Stage 1
- Research findings and requirements documents
- Tech stack variables (`{BACKEND_FRAMEWORK}`, `{FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK}`, `{DATABASE}`)

### Activities

**MUST** dispatch specialist agents via `agent:dispatch` based on the tech stack. Do NOT produce architecture inline — delegate to specialist agents:

#### Backend Architecture (dispatch if `{BACKEND_FRAMEWORK}` is set)

**MUST** dispatch `backend-architect` with:

- Research findings from Stage 1
- Requirements document from Stage 1
- Instruction to produce:
  - Service decomposition and responsibilities
  - Data flow between services and external dependencies
  - API design: endpoint structure, versioning, authentication
  - Asynchronous patterns (queues, events, webhooks) if applicable
  - Error handling and retry strategy

#### Frontend Architecture (dispatch if `{FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK}` is set)

**MUST** dispatch `frontend-architect` with:

- Research findings from Stage 1
- Requirements document from Stage 1
- Instruction to produce:
  - Component hierarchy and data ownership
  - State management approach
  - Server-side vs. client-side rendering strategy
  - Routing structure
  - Data-fetching patterns (SSR, SWR, polling)

#### UI/UX Design (dispatch if feature has user-facing surfaces)

**MUST** dispatch `frontend-designer` with:

- Research findings and requirements
- Instruction to produce:
  - User flows and wireframe descriptions
  - Key screen layouts (ASCII diagram format)
  - Component inventory (existing vs. new)
  - Responsive behavior and breakpoints
  - Color and typography alignment with `Weather Platform` brand identity

**MUST** collect all agent outputs before proceeding to Stage 3. Do NOT proceed with partial outputs unless an agent dispatch failed (see Error Handling).

### Outputs

- Backend architecture output (service decomposition, API contracts, async patterns)
- Frontend architecture output (component hierarchy, state management, routing)
- UI/UX design output (user flows, wireframes, component inventory)

### Exit Criteria

- All applicable specialist agents dispatched and outputs collected
- Each agent output covers its full instruction set
- All outputs ready for cross-review in Stage 3

---

## Stage 3: Review

### Inputs

- Backend architecture output from Stage 2
- Frontend architecture output from Stage 2
- UI/UX design output from Stage 2

### Activities

Cross-review agent outputs for conflicts and gaps:

1. **Backend reviews frontend design:**
   - **MUST** dispatch `backend-architect` with frontend architecture output
   - Check: Are API contracts compatible with the component data requirements?
   - Flag any mismatches in data shapes, pagination, or auth flow

2. **Frontend reviews backend design:**
   - **MUST** dispatch `frontend-architect` with backend architecture output
   - Check: Do data contract definitions match the frontend state model?
   - Flag any performance concerns (over-fetching, missing indexes)

3. Collect conflict flags from both reviews

4. For each conflict:
   - Determine the correct resolution based on project constraints
   - Record the resolution and rationale as an open ADR candidate (to be formalized via `design-adr`)

5. **MUST** present cross-review summary before proceeding to Stage 4. Do NOT skip the summary or proceed directly to documentation.

### Outputs

- Cross-review conflict flags from both specialist reviews
- Resolution and rationale for each conflict
- ADR candidates list for decisions requiring formal documentation
- Cross-review summary

### Exit Criteria

- Both cross-reviews (backend-of-frontend, frontend-of-backend) completed
- All conflicts identified, resolved, and documented with rationale
- Cross-review summary presented and confirmed before documentation

---

## Stage 4: Document

### Inputs

- All specialist agent outputs from Stage 2
- Cross-review resolutions and ADR candidates from Stage 3
- Tech stack variables and project constants from Stage 1
- `CONFLUENCE_ENABLED` from project constants

### Activities

Produce the architecture document incorporating all agent outputs and review resolutions:

1. Write the design document to local docs (always):

   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/docs/design/"
   ```

   Write to `docs/design/architecture-{slug}.md` with YAML frontmatter: `title`, `status: draft`, `type: design`, `date`
   Use `docs/local:doc-create` if the file does not exist, or `docs/local:doc-update` if it does.

2. After local write succeeds, check `CONFLUENCE_ENABLED` from project constants:
   - If `CONFLUENCE_ENABLED=true`: call `confluence-publish` for the written file, with labels `current`, `specdesign` in `` space
     - On publish failure: display a warning and preserve the local artifact — do NOT block or stop
   - If `CONFLUENCE_ENABLED` is not set or false: skip Confluence publish

3. Document structure:

   ```markdown
   # Architecture: {Feature or System}

   **Date:** {date}
   **Status:** Draft
   **Tech Stack:** {FRONTEND_FRAMEWORK} + {BACKEND_FRAMEWORK} + {DATABASE}

   ## System Overview

- Confluence page synced (if `CONFLUENCE_ENABLED=true`)
